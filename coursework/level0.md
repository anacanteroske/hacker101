Level 0: Breakerbank
====================

In this exercise, you're presented with a bank account interface. There are many instances of the bugs we've discussed so far, along with some that we haven't yet talked about.

Hint: A logic flaw in the application will give you a sample report for one of the bugs, giving you a nice template to work from.
