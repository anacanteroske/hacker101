Welcome to Hacker101!
=====================

Hacker101 is a free class for web security.  Whether you're a programmer with an interest in bug bounties or a seasoned security professional, Hacker101 has something to teach you.

Structure
---------

Hacker101 is structured as a set of video lessons -- some covering multiple bugs, some covering a single one -- and can be consumed in two different ways.  You can either watch them in the order produced as in a normal class, or you can watch individual videos.  If you're new to security, we recommend the former.
