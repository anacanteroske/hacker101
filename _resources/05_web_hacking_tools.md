<ul>
	<li><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a>: This is the most popular proxy in web hacking circles due to its cross-platform nature and extensive featureset. See <a href="playlists/burp_suite">our playlist</a> to make the most of it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>: This is an open-source proxy written in Python.  Not recommended for beginners, but this can be a powerful tool.</li>
	<li><a href="http://sqlmap.org/">sqlmap</a>: This allows for easy discovery and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. It <b>will not</b> catch every bug or even be able to exploit some known SQLi bugs. What it will do is make your life much easier in the 80% of cases it will work for.</li>
