title: iOS Hacking - Webviews

The final video in our iOS application hacking series focuses on the complex world of iOS webviews.  You’ll learn about the history of webview insecurity on iOS and how newer webview classes offer improved security when used correctly.  We’ll also demonstrate how to trace webview activity at runtime using frida-trace and customize our trace output to capture the specifics of a web view’s behavior.
